The **ALX Listing App** is a front-end web application inspired by Airbnb‚Äôs listing page. It is built using **Next.js 13+**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ESLint** as part of the ALX Pro Development program.

The goal of this project is to build a responsive and scalable property listing page that demonstrates best practices in modern front-end development, including component reusability, clean code architecture, and type safety.
